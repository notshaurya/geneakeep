## Features
- List of notes is shown via localStorage as well as redux.
- Add note - Clicking anywhere outside the popover will save the note along with save button.
- Option to choose between plain-text and list in note content.
- Task complete - User is able to check any item in list and that is marked as completed by striking the text out. Note: Checked item will be moved to bottom once the note is saved. Not immediately as user will not be able to recognize the position.
- Drag and Drop - Self implementation of drag and drop is done. User needs to drop a note onto another note to change its position. Dropping on empty space will not apply.
- Responsive view
- Bonus Feature - User is able to change the background color of the note while editing. Saved color of a note will be available in the main notes screen as well.

## Extra Features

- Notes Search - User will be able to search through the title of the notes the moment a text is entered.
- Portfolio - An icon is given on top right which redirects to the developer portfolio once clicked.
